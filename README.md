# Schedule
All shows are planned for one hour, but may take longer depending on the audience and guests. 
Family and work always have a higher priority, that's why I cannot really schedule the shows on a long term. I'll do short term announcement, except I have a special guest, who needs some schedules. I'm going to do the announcements on twitter and here in this repo. Follow this repo or follow me on Twitter to get notified about the shows. https://twitter.com/sharpcms 

# Working on sharpcms - Moving a legacy ASP.NET application to ASP.NET Core
The sharpcms is a pretty old C# CMS, which I own together with @thomas3577. We got the project ownership many years ago from a Danish developer who stopped maintaining it. I'd like to move the sharpcms to ASP.NET Core together with you and some other experts who will join the stream as guests.

# Lunch4Lunch - Building a new awesome ASP.NET Core application from scratch
This is a nice idea we had and we currently live in the YOO (http://yooapps.com). If someone prepares lunch at home, he can prepare some more and offer it to the colleagues. For every lunch he prepares, he will earn a coin. Everyone who wants to eat a portion need to kinda "pay" a coin to the cook. The one who cooks tells the colleagues: "I have two more portions of this super awesome yummy thing. Who wants one?" Than you are able to reserve a meal. With the coins you get, you are able to also eat a meal, cooked by another colleague.

I'd like to move away from Excel and create a cross plat web app to support that Idea a little more: 
* Meal proposals 
* Meal reservations
* Coin wallet
* And much more...

# The Friday show
This is the little more lazy show, which also may be a little more flexible than the others. It will be a little bit like the ASP.NET Community standup, but I'd also like to invite some experts from the community to discuss the latest cool and awesome things that happen in the community. (This may be blog posts, demos, new tools, events and many more.)

# Ask me enything
I also plan to do a "Ask me enything" show. File an issue to ask a question on that repository: https://github.com/JuergenGutschOnTwitch/AskMeAnythingSession/issues
If there are some questions, which will fill a one hour show, I'll schedule a special one or do it on Friday afternoon. We'll see :-)
