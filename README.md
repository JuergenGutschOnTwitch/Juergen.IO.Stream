# sharpcms
The sharpcms is a pretty old C# CMS, that I own together with @thomas3577. We got the project ownership many years ago from the danish developer. I'd like to move the sharpcms to ASP.NET Core together with you and some other experts who will join the stream as geuests.

Hope I get @thomas3577 for the first stream.

# Lunch4Lunch
This is a nice idea we had and we currently live in the YOO (http://yooapps.com). If somone prepares lunch at home, he can prepare some more and offer it to the collegues. For every lunch he prepares, he will earn a coin. Everyone who wants to eat a portion need to kinda "pay" a coin to the cook. The one who cooks tells the colleagues: "I have two more portions of this super awesome yumy thing. Who wants one?" Than you are able to reserve a meal. With the coins you get, you are able to also eat a meal, cooked by another colleague.

I'd like to move away from Excel and create a cross plat web app to suport that Idea a little more: 
* Meal proposals 
* Meal reservations
* Coin wallet
* And much more...
