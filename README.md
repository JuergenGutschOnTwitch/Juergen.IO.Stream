# Schedule
(Time in CET)
All shows are planned for one hour, but may take longer depending on the audience and guests.
* Monday 9:00pm
  * Working on sharpcms
* Wednesday 8:00am
  * Working on the lunch4lunch app
* Friday 4:00 pm
  * Inviting a guest and discuss current  ASP.NET  related topics 
This is just a plan. I'll try to follow this plan as best as possible. But family and work always have a higher priority, so it may happen that I need to cancel or move a show if there are some conflicts.

# sharpcms
The sharpcms is a pretty old C# CMS, that I own together with @thomas3577. We got the project ownership many years ago from the danish developer. I'd like to move the sharpcms to ASP.NET Core together with you and some other experts who will join the stream as geuests.

Hope I get @thomas3577 for the first stream.

# Lunch4Lunch
This is a nice idea we had and we currently live in the YOO (http://yooapps.com). If somone prepares lunch at home, he can prepare some more and offer it to the collegues. For every lunch he prepers, he will earn a coin. Everyone who wants to eat a portion need to kinda "pay" a coin to the cook. The one who cooks tells the collegues: "I have two more portions of this super awesome yumy thing. Who wants one?" Than you are able to reserver ameal. With the coins you get, you are able to also eat a meal the was cooked by another collegue.

I'd like to move away from Excel and create a cross plat web app to suport that Idea a little more: 
* Meal proposals 
* Meal reservations
* Coin wallet
* And much more...

# The friday show
This show my be a litle bit like the ASP.NET Community standup, but I'd like to invite some experts from the communtiy ti diskuss the latest cool and awesome things that happen in the communtiy. This may blog posts, new tools, events and many more. 

# Ask me everyting
