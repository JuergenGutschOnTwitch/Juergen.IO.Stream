# Juergen.IO.Stream
This repos is about organising, scheduling and planning the stream on twitch 

* File a new issue in case you like to propose topics or if you have feedback and question which directly relate to this stream.
* Watch this repo to retreive all important news 

# Schedule
(Time in CET)
All shows are planned for one hour, but may take longer depending on the audience and guests.
* Monday 9:00 pm
  * Working on sharpcms
* Wednesday 8:00 am
  * Working on the Lunch4Lunch app
* Friday 4:00 pm
  * The Friday show: Inviting one or two special guests sand discuss current  ASP.NET related topics

This is just a plan. I'll try to follow this plan as best as possible. But family and work always have a higher priority, so it may happen that I need to cancel or move a show if there are some conflicts.

# Working on sharpcms - Moving a legacy ASP.NET application to ASP.NET Core
The sharpcms is a pretty old C# CMS, which I own together with @thomas3577. We got the project ownership many years ago from a danish developer who stopped maintaining it. I'd like to move the sharpcms to ASP.NET Core together with you and some other experts who will join the stream as guests.

Hope I'll get @thomas3577 for the first stream (and some more). That would be super awesome :)

# Lunch4Lunch - Building a new awesome ASP.NET Core application from scratch
This is a nice idea we had and we currently live in the YOO (http://yooapps.com). If somone prepares lunch at home, he can prepare some more and offer it to the colleagues. For every lunch he prepares, he will earn a coin. Everyone who wants to eat a portion need to kinda "pay" a coin to the cook. The one who cooks tells the colleagues: "I have two more portions of this super awesome yumy thing. Who wants one?" Than you are able to reserve a meal. With the coins you get, you are able to also eat a meal, cooked by another colleague.

I'd like to move away from Excel and create a cross plat web app to suport that Idea a little more: 
* Meal proposals 
* Meal reservations
* Coin wallet
* And much more...

# The Friday show
This is the littel more lazy show, which also may be a little more flexible than the others. It will be a litle bit like the ASP.NET Community standup, but I'd also like to invite some experts from the community to discuss the latest cool and awesome things that happen in the community. (This may be blog posts, demos, new tools, events and many more.)

# Ask me everyting
I also plan to do a "Ask me everyting" show. File an issue to ask a question on that repository: https://github.com/JuergenGutschOnTwitch/AskMeAnythingSession/issues
If there are some questions, which will fill a one hour show, I'll schedule a special one or do it on Friday afternoon. We'll see :-)
